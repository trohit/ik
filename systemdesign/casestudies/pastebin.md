# Problem
Design Pastebin, a website where you can store and share text online for a set period of time.
Note: Bit.ly is a similar service, with the distinction that Pastebin requires storing the paste contents instead of the original unshortened URL.

# Similar Case studies
- similar to bit.ly or URL shortener
- needs a unique id that needs to be allocated in a distributed manner
- different in the sense that we may need additional storage to store the pastebin contents
- also may need security angle
