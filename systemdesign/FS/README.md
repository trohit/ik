# Distributed Filesystems for analytics
- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):
  - Developed as part of the Apache Hadoop project.
  - Designed to store and manage large amounts of data reliably across commodity hardware.
  - Widely used in conjunction with Hadoop MapReduce/ Spark  for distributed processing.
  - Used alongwith Presto for analytics using SQL like queries
  - How HDFS works
    - has 2 kinds of nodes : NameNodes and DataNodes
    - DataNodes store data and NameNodes keep track of which DataNode stores what data
    - In case NameNode goes down, there is a secondary NameNode that takes over.
    - Each file is split into 128MB or 256MB chunks and then stored across various DataNodes
    - For redundancy and availability, at least 3 replicas of the data exist, in different nodes.
    - As HDFS has rack awareness, these replicas are stored in DataNodes across different racks.   
- Google File System (GFS):
  - Developed by Google as a proprietary file system for their internal use.
  - Served as an inspiration for HDFS and other distributed file systems.
  - Designed for high reliability, scalability, and efficient data processing.
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3):
  - Although not a traditional file system, it is a widely used object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
  - Popular for storing large amounts of unstructured data in a distributed and scalable manner.
- Ceph:
  - An open-source distributed storage system that provides object, block, and file storage in a single platform.
  - Known for its scalability, high performance, and ability to run on commodity hardware.
- GlusterFS:
  - An open-source, distributed file system that can scale horizontally.
  - It aggregates storage resources across nodes in a cluster to provide a single, unified namespace.
- Apache Cassandra:
  - Initially designed as a distributed NoSQL database, Cassandra also provides support for storing large amounts of data across a cluster.
  - Known for its high availability, fault tolerance, and linear scalability.
