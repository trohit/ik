# Interesting concepts
- https://12factor.net/
- [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)
- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) : mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
- [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) :  distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table.
- [LSM Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree)
  - data structure that came on the scene in 1996 as an alternative to B+Trees(1970)
  - LSM suitable for high insert volume such as audit logs, debug trails and write-intensive workloads.
  - Refs
- Operations
  - commutative : if the ordering of events doesnt matter then its commutative.
    - example addition and multiplication are commutative, whereas subtraction and division are not
    - 3*9 is the same as 9*3 but 9/3 is not the same as 3/9
  - idempodent: where if the opertaion runs once or multiple times, the end result is the same.
    - eg. i = i+1 is not idempodent but i = 2 is idempodent
  - associativity: a associated with b means b is also associated with a
- Fault tolerance
  - Game days or storm days : should be done to simulate service failures like web|DNS|DB tier failures, node failures, AZ failures, Region failures every 3-6 months
  - For Devops , should closely track SLI, SLO, are well within SLA limits in terns of uptime, latency, jitter and accuracy.
    - Other patterns for fault management
      - Circuit breaker : to allow open / close of a service when isolating faults, after repeated timeouts call ckt breaker, later open slowly to prevent thundering herd problems
      - Runtime Knobs : the ability to rollback a new feature / behavior in production to RCA issues
      - Dead letter Queue: when a msg in msgq cant be processed for some reason say due to exception, then push into a dead letter DB / mortician database.
        - Once problem & fix is identified, republish the event.
  - Sys design patterns : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH4qjmP2KEE 
    - Ambassador pattern: offloads tasks like logging monitoring, retries, enhances security. eg Envoy for k8s
    - Circuit Breaker pattern: prevents cascading failure
    - CQRS: separating reads from writes to allow each to scale independently
    - Event Sourcing: keeping journal of live events eg. git commit history, change data capture, Pravega
    - Leader Election Pattern: Zookeeper, etc for distributed consistent config
    - Pub/Sub: eg. msg qs, Google Cloud Pub/Sub
    - Sharding pattern: distribute data across many nodes, reducing load eg. cassandra / Mongo
    - Outboxer pattern: maintains consistency between different services in a distributed system. eg. payments need to go to ledger and balance, chat msgs need to go to notifications and chatDB
  - Models
    - Actor model: where an object has state and behavior. useful for scaling and high concurrence without race and deadlocks. eg. used by Erlang and Akka
