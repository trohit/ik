  - commutative : if the ordering of events doesnt matter then its commutative.
    - example addition and multiplication are commutative, whereas subtraction and division are not
    - 3*9 is the same as 9*3 but 9/3 is not the same as 3/9
  - idempodent: where if the opertaion runs once or multiple times, the end result is the same.
    - eg. i = i+1 is not idempodent but i = 2 is idempodent
