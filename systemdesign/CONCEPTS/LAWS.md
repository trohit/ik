- Rohit's Law: the easier it is to understand a law and to relate to, the more useful it becomes.

# Product Features and Design and Anti-patterns
- [Worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better): Software quality does not necessarily increase with functionality: that there is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability.
- [Brandolini's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law), aka bullshit asymmetry principle: The amount of energy needed to refute misinformation is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.
- [Second system effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect): The tendency of small, elegant, and successful systems to be succeeded by over-engineered, bloated systems, due to inflated expectations and overconfidence.
- [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law): Work expands to fill its available time
- [Gall's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law):A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.
- [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle): for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes
- [Hitchens Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchens%27s_razor): what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.
- [Edholm's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edholm%27s_law): bandwidth and data rates double every 18 months, which has proven to be true since the 1970s
- [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law): number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. No longer relevant since 2023 and is fatlining, being replaced by quantum computing.
- 
- [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law): The financial value or influence of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2)
- [Conways Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law): Orgs that produce systems are constrained to produce designs that are copies of communication structures of these orgs. Similar to Inner-platform effect.
- [Inner-platform effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner-platform_effect) :  tendency of software architects to create a system so customizable as to become a replica, and often a poor replica, of the software development platform they are using. Similar to Conways Law
- [Zawinskys Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski#Zawinski's_Law): Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.
- [Osborne effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect):  social phenomenon of customers canceling or deferring orders for the current, soon-to-be-obsolete product as an unexpected drawback of a company's announcing a future product prematurely.
- [Software Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Peter_principle): a dying project which has become too complex to be understood even by its own developers.

  

# Execution
- [90-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety%E2%80%93ninety_rule): The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.

  
# Organization
- Organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure. (Melvin Conway, 1967)
- [Brooke's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law): Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
  
# Release Management
- Feature Branching is a poor man's modular architecture, instead of building systems with the ability to easy swap in and out features at runtime/deploytime they couple themselves to the source control providing this mechanism through manual merging.  (Dan Bodart)
