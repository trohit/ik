# Product Features and Design
- [Worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better): Software quality does not necessarily increase with functionality: that there is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability.
- [Brandolini's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law), aka bullshit asymmetry principle: The amount of energy needed to refute misinformation is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it.


  
# Organization
- Organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structure. (Melvin Conway, 1967)
- [Brooke's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law): Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
  
# Release Management
- Feature Branching is a poor man's modular architecture, instead of building systems with the ability to easy swap in and out features at runtime/deploytime they couple themselves to the source control providing this mechanism through manual merging.  (Dan Bodart)
