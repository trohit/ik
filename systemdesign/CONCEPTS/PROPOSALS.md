# Principles of Management

## Ways to make a proposal
### [Heilmeier Catechism](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/research/ordc/Resources/heilmeier-catechism.php)
- What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
- How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice? Why are improvements needed? What are the consequences of doing nothing?
- What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful? What preliminary work have you done? How have you tested your assumptions on a small scale?
- Who cares? Identify your stakeholders. Who will benefit from your successful project?
- If you're successful, what difference will it make? What will your successful project mean for your research? For the infrastructure of your institution and future capabilites? For your discipline? Related disciplines? For society? For the funding agency? What applications are enabled as a result?
- What are the risks and the payoffs? Why are the potential rewards worth the risk? What have you done to mitigate risk? What's Plan B?
- How much will it cost? How long will it take? Who needs to be involved to ensure success? What institutional resources need to be committed?
- What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success? How will you assess progress and make midcourse corrections? What are the metrics for success? How will you know you're done?

### [Completed Staff coursework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completed_staff_work)
- Principle of management which states that subordinates are responsible for submitting written recommendations to superiors in such a manner that the superior need do nothing further in the process than review the submitted document and indicate approval or disapproval.
- Should include:
  - Study of the problem
  - Presentation of a solution 
- The final test of completed staff work is:
  - If you were the commander would you be willing to sign the paper you have prepared, and stake your professional reputation on its being right?
  - If the answer is no, take it back and work it over, because it is not yet “completed staff work.”
