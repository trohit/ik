# GFS
- Designed to be Scalable + Fault Tolerant + Handle Large Files + Large seq & small rand reads + Seq writes + High concurrency + High Throughput
- Usecases: Gmail OR YouTube, originally for crawling & indexing system, Also used by BigTable to store log & data files
- Not POSIX level compliant suports create, read, write, delete, open, close 
- Also supports Snapshots and Append ops
- GFS stores a big file in chunks of 64MB
- Each chunk identified by 64 bit unique chunk handle
- FR of GFS:
  - split file into chunks
  - map file to chunks
  - support stad ops on files
- All GFS clusters contain: A single Master server + many chunk servers + many clients
- Chunk servers store chunks as regular linux files and can handles reads and writes for chunks at byte sized offsets
- GFS Master server is the coordinator of a GFS Cluster and responsible for
  - keeping track of cluster metadata. metadata includes:
    - Name and path of each file
    - mapping files to chunk and chunk locations
    - chunks ACL
  - GFS Master also manager chunk lease mgmt, GC of orphaned chunks and migration of chunks b.w chunkservers
  - GFS Master periodically communicates heartbeats with all the chunk servers
  - For perf & latency, all metadata stored on GFS Master. Incl whole FS namespace + file->chunk mappings
  - Master is a SPOF so the matadata is replicated to many remote machines
  - Client is any node that reads / writes to GFS. Clients talk to Master for all metadata updates and modifications. Neither client nor chunkservers explicitly cache data apart from the linux buf cache.
