# AWS Location Types
- https://infrastructure.aws/
- AWS Regions, Availability Zones, Local Zones, AWS Outposts, and Wavelength Zone
- 99 Availability Zones within 31 geographic regions: 15 more AZs and 5 more region planned
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html
- Region
  - Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area eg, us-east-1
  - Each region is a cluster of DCs and is composed of min. 3 AZs.
  - 
- AZ
  - AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, independent cooling and connectivity in an AWS Region. 
  - All AZs in an AWS Region are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking, over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber providing high-throughput, low-latency networking between AZs. All traffic between AZs is encrypted. The network performance is sufficient to accomplish synchronous replication between AZs.
  - AZs make partitioning applications for high availability easy.
  - AZs are within 100 km (60 miles) of each other.
  - one or more DCs that share power|networking|cooling, so share same failure domain
  - each az is separate from the other in that if one fails the other should still be up.
  - eg. us-east-1[a|b|c]

- Local Zones
  - LZs place compute, storage, database, and other select AWS services closer to end-users. 
  - With AWS Local Zones, you can easily run highly-demanding applications that require single-digit millisecond latencies to your end-users
  - such as media & entertainment content creation, real-time gaming, reservoir simulations, electronic design automation, and machine learning.
  - Each LZ  location is an extension of an AWS Region where you can run your latency sensitive applications  

- AWS Wavelength
  - AW enables developers to build applications that deliver single-digit millisecond latencies to mobile devices and end-users.
  - AWS developers can deploy their applications to Wavelength Zones 
  
- AWS Outposts
  - AO bring native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to virtually any data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility.
  - You can use the same AWS APIs, tools, and infrastructure across on-premises and the AWS cloud to deliver a truly consistent hybrid experience.
 
  
# AWS Pricing Fundamentals
- Pay as you go pricing for Compute | Storage | Data txfer _OUT_ of cloud (IN is FREE)

# VPC

- a logical contruct that overlays across all az's in a region
- a vpc can have subnets in multiple AZ's
- not restricted to single subnet per AZ.
- traffic between diff subnets in the same AZ is called intra-zone(not charged)
- traffic between diff subnets across AZ's is called inter-zone traffic.(chargeable)
- 1 VPC : m subnets : upto m x n instances
- When creating a VPC need to specify CIDR range (/16 | /28) for that VPC to use.
  - /16 gives 2^(32 -'16' - 2 => 65534 usable IPv4 IPs
  - /28 gives 2^(32 -'28' - 2 => 2 usable IPs.
  - RFC 1918 CIDR addrs preferred
    - 10.x.y.z/8 | 192.168.x.y/16 | 172.168.0.0/12
    - In each subnet we create in a VPC, AWS reserves 5 of those usable IPs.    
      - resvd addrs
      - +0: network address
      - +1: gateway
      - +2: DNS
      - +3: future use
      - +last: bcast not allowed

  - IPv6 VPCs
    - All IPv6 addrs in AWS VPCs are in /56 subnet
    - No extra charge from AWS for allocation of Ipv6 addr
    - No distinction between public and pvt IPv6 addrs as there are no pvt IPv6 addrs
  - ENI : Elastic Network Interface
    - Can move ENI from one EC2 VM to another dynamically
    - An ENI needs to have one primary IP and can have multiple secondary IPs.
  - Placement groups
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/466385/230322408-87bbee1f-271e-4665-b322-0026e49dcb1f.png)
    - Placement groups types - Cluster|Partition|Spread
  - Public and Pvt Subnets
    - Route Tables: collection of tules of how to move traffic in / out of the VPC
    - Types of route tables : Main Route table| Custom Route Table | Gateway Table | Local Gateway
      - A Main route table is created each time you create a VPC
      - Custom route table/s
   - Routes
     - Route = Dest + Target + IPv(4|6) + Route Priority
       - Target is a next Hop. 0.0.0.0/0 is the most generic default route
       - Route selection: most specific route is always chosen. eg 10.0.0.0/24 more specific than 10.0.0.0/16
       - diff types of Targets | Next Hops:
         - Internet Gateway
         - Egress Only Internet Gateway
           - by default each VM gets pvt IPv4 and IPv6 addr
           - If a route exists in the VM to reach the internet, anyone knowng the VM IPv6 addr can reach it from outside
           - So AWS created the Egress Only Internet Gateway (Egress-Only IGW) that does not allow incoming reqs from outside
         - NAT Gateway
         - Outpost Local Gateway
         - Transit Gateway
         - Virtual Pvt Gateway
         - (NAT) Instance
         - Network Interface in the VPC : 
         - Peering Connection : to get from one VPC to another if it matches Dest CIDR range
       - Subnet types
         - All subnets send traffic to the dafult route which is the +1 addr. viz. a.b.c.1 or 10.x.y.1  
         - Public Subnet : where a route exists to the internet gateway
         - Pvt Subnet: where no route to the internet gateway exists   
      - Internet Gateway
        - is a highly available distributed service provided by AWS
        - Internet Gateway simply needs to be attached to a VPC to have interet routable traffic
        - Public IPs and Elastic IPs(public IPv4 address) actually sit out with the Internet Gateway
        - subnet -> router -> IGW - > Internet
      - Diff bet NAT Gateway and NAT Instance
        - NAT G/w
          - AWS provided Service + Highly Available per AZ
          - Bandwidth : 45Gbps per flow but not scalable
          - Managed by AWS
          - Charged by #gateways + duration + amt of data in transit
          - no Port fwding support
          - no Bastion Host support
          - No support for security groups
          - More commonly used option
        - NAT Instance
          - EC2 instance, needs user script for manual F/O 
          - Bandwidth dependent on instance type
          - Managed by user
          - Charged by #instances + duration + instance type|size
          - Can be lower cost option than NAT instance
          - Has Port fwding support
          - Has Bastion Host support: can connect instances on pbt subnet
          - Can associate + has support for security groups
