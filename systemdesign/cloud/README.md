# Characteristics of cloud computing
- On-demand self service : no human interaction needed to provision resources
- Broad n/w access : resurces on network so can be accessed by deiverse client platforms 
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling : many cust can share same infra with seciruty + privacy & many cust serviced from the same resources
- Rapid elasticity and scalability: create | dispose resources as needed + quickly + easily scale based on demand
- Measured service: users pay only for what they use

# +ves of of cloud computing 
- Flexibility | Cost effectiveness | Scalability | HA + Fault tolerance | Elasticity | Agility 

```
Platform	Examples
PaaS	AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, and Adobe Commerce
SaaS	Gmail, Slack, and Microsoft Office 365
IaaS	Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine

# Service Models
## Platform as a service (PaaS)
- Provide Building blocks for IT
- Provide network + computers + mem + storage space
- Highest level of flexibility
- Very close alternative to trad on-prem IT

## Infrastructure as a service (SaaS)
- Removes need for org to manage underlying infra
- Focus on deployment and mgmt of your apps

## Software as a service (SaaS)
- Completed product that is run _ managed by the service provider

## Mobile "backend" as a service (MBaaS)

## Serverless computing or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)

# Deployment models
## Private cloud
## Public cloud
## Hybrid cloud
## Others
- Community cloud
- Distributed cloud
- Multicloud
- Poly cloud
- Big data cloud
- HPC cloud
# Limitations and disadvantages
# Emerging trends
# Digital forensics in the cloud
