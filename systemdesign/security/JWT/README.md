# JWT
- JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.
  - This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.
  -  JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA.
 
  ## When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
  - Authentication
  - Info Exchg
 
  ## Why not use cookies instead of JWT ?
  - JWT is simply a token format.
  - A cookie is an HTTP state management mechanism really.
  - A web cookie can contain JWT and can be stored within your browserâ€™s Cookies storage.
