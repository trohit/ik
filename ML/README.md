# Terms:
- AI: abiity of a digital system to do tasks otherwise done by humans
- ML: subset of AI that uses algos & stat modelsto learn & predict based o data without being explicitly programmed to do so.
- DL: subset of ML that uses ANN (artificial neunets) to simulate the human bains structure & fn.
- GANS(Generative adversarial networks):  Generates realistic data by adversarial trg of neunets, one that acts as a generator to produce pseudo synthetic data and another nenet called discriminator, which learns to distinguish true data from the generators input.
  - goal of generator to fool the discriminator neunet by making generator neunet believe the synthetic data is real
  - goal of discriminator to differentiate synthetic from real data by emitting a probability indicating whether the given data is real or fake.
  - applications of GANs: realistic image generation, text2image transaltion, video generation, data augmentation, deepfake detection
- GPT(Generative pretrained transformer): GPT models utilize a txformer model architecture to process tokens in a sequence and predict the next token.
  - much better than previous NLP models that needed large labeled datasets.
- Hallucinations: phenomenon where LLms provide data that is factually incorrect
- RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation):
