As an Engineering Manager or Software Engineer, your brain is your greatest asset. Here's how to keep it sharp, not shredded:

𝟭/ 𝗥𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
- Start by slashing your to-do list.
- If it’s not moving the needle, it’s moving you backward.
- Adopt the 80/20 rule: 20% of your actions drive 80% of your results. 
  - Identify those actions. Focus there. Relentlessly.

𝟮/ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺
- Carve your day into power blocks.
- Three hours in the morning. Two in the afternoon.
  - During these blocks, your only job is to produce your highest value work.
    - No emails.
    - No calls.
    - Pure, undiluted focus.

𝟯/ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗿𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗟𝗮𝘇𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀
- Yes, laziness - but make it strategic.
- Schedule your downtime.
- Your brain isn’t wired to go full-throttle 24/7.
- It needs rest to process and recharge.
- Take a walk. Meditate. Nap.
- High performance isn’t a sprint; it’s a well-paced marathon.

𝟰/ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝘄𝗼-𝗠𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲 𝗥𝘂𝗹𝗲
- If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately.
- This simple rule keeps small tasks from piling up and turning into mental clutter.
- Keep your mind clear for the big plays.

𝟱/ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽
- Dedicate 30 minutes daily to learning. 
- Read. Listen. Watch. 
- High performers are perpetual students. 
- Oh and remember, Knowledge X Action = Power. 

𝟲/ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗳𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗥𝗶𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹
- End your day with 10 minutes of reflection.
- What worked? What didn’t?
- High performance is about constant iteration.
- You can’t improve what you don’t measure.

𝟳/ 𝗦𝗹𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗟𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗮 𝗣𝗿𝗼
- Lastly, and most importantly, prioritize sleep.
- Your brain’s ability to problem-solve, innovate, and think critically is directly tied to your sleep quality.
- It’s not a luxury; it’s a necessity.
- 7-9 hours (Non-negotiable) 

𝗜𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻:
- The goal is not to be busy but to be impactful.
- Redefine your routine, redefine your life.
