# Impactful advice to be more productive
## Alamanac of Nava Ravikant
- Whats more important than what you work on is who you work with.
- Stay to the basics. Read and try to have a coherent view of others people point of view.
- Easy choice. Hard life. Hard choice. Easy life.
- Best founder is a Long term thinker. Fix every little problem. Passion and vision is not enough. Luck matters. 
- Learn to build, learn to sell. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable
- Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.
- I don't have time == not a priority
- No School teaches the importance of  
  - nutrition 
  - cooking 
  - happy relationships 
  - how to keep body healthy 
  - how to be happy 
  - meditation
  - These are the things we need to focus on
- Forty hour workweeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes — train and sprint, then rest and reassess.
- A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought — they must be earned.
- Information is everywhere but its meaning is created by the observer that interprets it. Meaning is relative and there is no objective, over-arching meaning.
- Smart money is just dumb money that’s been through a crash.
- The secret to public speaking is to speak as if you were alone.
- Sophisticated foods are bittersweet (wine, beer, coffee, chocolate). Addictive relationships are cooperative and competitive. Work becomes flow at the limits of ability. The flavor of life is on the edge.
- A personal metric: how much of the day is spent doing things out of obligation rather than out of interest?

As an Engineering Manager or Software Engineer, your brain is your greatest asset. Here's how to keep it sharp, not shredded:

𝟭/ 𝗥𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
- Start by slashing your to-do list.
- If it’s not moving the needle, it’s moving you backward.
- Adopt the 80/20 rule: 20% of your actions drive 80% of your results. 
  - Identify those actions. Focus there. Relentlessly.

𝟮/ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺
- Carve your day into power blocks.
- Three hours in the morning. Two in the afternoon.
  - During these blocks, your only job is to produce your highest value work.
    - No emails.
    - No calls.
    - Pure, undiluted focus.

𝟯/ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗿𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗟𝗮𝘇𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀
- Yes, laziness - but make it strategic.
- Schedule your downtime.
- Your brain isn’t wired to go full-throttle 24/7.
- It needs rest to process and recharge.
- Take a walk. Meditate. Nap.
- High performance isn’t a sprint; it’s a well-paced marathon.

𝟰/ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝘄𝗼-𝗠𝗶𝗻𝘂𝘁𝗲 𝗥𝘂𝗹𝗲
- If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately.
- This simple rule keeps small tasks from piling up and turning into mental clutter.
- Keep your mind clear for the big plays.

𝟱/ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽
- Dedicate 30 minutes daily to learning. 
- Read. Listen. Watch. 
- High performers are perpetual students. 
- Oh and remember, Knowledge X Action = Power. 

𝟲/ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗳𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗥𝗶𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹
- End your day with 10 minutes of reflection.
- What worked? What didn’t?
- High performance is about constant iteration.
- You can’t improve what you don’t measure.

𝟳/ 𝗦𝗹𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗟𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗮 𝗣𝗿𝗼
- Lastly, and most importantly, prioritize sleep.
- Your brain’s ability to problem-solve, innovate, and think critically is directly tied to your sleep quality.
- It’s not a luxury; it’s a necessity.
- 7-9 hours (Non-negotiable) 

𝗜𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻:
- The goal is not to be busy but to be impactful.
- Redefine your routine, redefine your life.
